This project contains several Bash scripts. Below is a brief description of each script:

## `chmod u+x hello`

This script grants execute permission to the user (owner) for a file named "hello." It allows the owner of the file to run it as an executable.

## `groups`

This script prints the groups that the current user is a member of. It can be used to check which groups the user belongs to.

## `chown betty hello`

This script changes the owner of the "hello" file to a user named "betty." This means that "betty" will have ownership and control over the file.

## `touch hello`

This script creates an empty file named "hello" if it does not already exist. If the file already exists, it updates the timestamp of the file.

## `chmod u+x hello`

This script, similar to the first one, grants execute permission to the user (owner) for the "hello" file. It ensures that the owner can run the file as an executable.

Please make sure to read and understand these scripts before running them, as they can have various effects on your system depending on the context in which they are used.

## `chmod u+x,g+x,o+r hello`

This script grants execute (`x`) permission to the user (`u`), group (`g`), and others (`o`) for the file named "hello." It also grants read (`r`) permission to others. This means that the owner, group members, and anyone else can execute and read the "hello" file.

## `chmod 007 hello`

This script sets the permissions for the "hello" file explicitly to "007," which translates to no permission for the owner, group, and read-only (`r`) permission for others.

## `chmod --reference=olleh hello`

This script copies the permissions from a file named "olleh" and applies them to the "hello" file. It essentially sets the same permissions as the "olleh" file on "hello."

## `chmod -R +x */`

This script recursively grants execute (`x`) permission to all files and directories within the current directory. It uses the wildcard `*/` to apply this permission to all subdirectories.

## `mkdir -m 751 my_dir`

This script creates a directory named "my_dir" with permissions set to "751." This means that the owner can read, write, and execute within the directory, while the group and others can only execute.

## `chown -R vincent:staff *`

This script recursively changes the ownership of all files and directories in the current directory to the user "vincent" and the group "staff."

## `chown -R vincent:staff _hello`

This script recursively changes the ownership of the directory "_hello" (assuming it's a directory) and all its contents to the user "vincent" and the group "staff."
